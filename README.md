# Balcony gardener
Agrotech final project 2023

We started the project thinking of our house plants that we love but not always know exactly what each one of them needs. Studying Agriculture, we often meet with friends and family’s questions about their house plants “What does this plant need in order for it  to be happy?”
In our experience it usually has something to do with water.. whether you water it too much, or too little, the result can seem quite similar for the naked eye - an unhappy plant presented with fallen leaves, blackened leaf edges ect.
And so, as we approach to examine ways to deal with the problem, we keep in mind that the final product should be as simple and user friendly as possible.
After 2 months of meeting, planning, drawing, collecting components, testing, soldering, testing again and of course not little research and learning - we present to you here THE BALCONY GARDENER.
With a compact device, you can input the size and type of plant using your phone, an automated decision making and calculations in the background will determine if and how much water the plant needs, and accordingly open the water. The kit includes a soil humidity sensor, a solenoid, and a small water tank.
We believe that the balcony gardener will allow more confidence among us - plants growers, especially because each of us can order and build it ourselves, with minimal expense and effort.
Have fun, and go make your plants happy!

## The sensors and devices we used:

To build your one balcony gardener you will need items from the following list: 
* ESP 32 firebeetle
* FDR soil humidity
* Solenoid
* Booster
* Relay
* 3.7V battery
* Some wires
* Some pipes and connectors


## Future work and improvements to make
Future work and improvements for the Balcony Gardener project could include:

* PAR Sensor: Adding a PAR sensor to evaluate if the plant is receiving sufficient light. This would provide additional information for optimal plant care.
* Convenient Water Container: Developing a more convenient water container system that ensures easy refilling and maintenance, enhancing the user experience.
* QR Code Monitoring: Implementing QR codes on each pot to monitor changes in soil humidity. This would allow users to track and analyze the plant's moisture levels over time.
* Independence from Client Interface: Considering the option to reduce dependence on the client interface by incorporating switches on the device itself. This would enable
